<p><b>Updated November 2, 2019:</b>Ubuntu 19.10 included a change of the enable-hot-corners setting. This created a <b>problem</b> for the Activities Configurator.  Version 77 of
the Activities Configurator is available with a fix for the Ubuntu 19.10 problem</p>

<p><b>Updated Octorber 30, 2019:</b>Ubuntu 19.10 included a change of the enable-hot-corners setting. This created a <b>problem</b> for the Activities Configurator. The setting was changed from global.settings
to Gio settings org.gnome.desktop.interface.  This change created a problem similar to one when 17.10 was released.
A new version of the extension has been uploaded for review which repairs the problem.  I am sure the Ubuntu developers had a reason for the change but I cannot imagine
what it might be.  For folks familar with the Gnome Tweaks tool the following tweak will clear up the problem until the new version of the extension can be installed.
With Tweaks, select Top Bar, then set the Activities Overview Hot Corner switch to ON, then restart your Gnome Session.

<p><b>Updated November 18, 2017:</b>
    Ubuntu 17.10 introduced a modified version of Gnome  Shell to provide a 'familiar Unity like experience'.
	 The Activities Configurator extension is now compatible with the Ubuntu default session.

<h4>Activities Configurator in Ubuntu 17.10 default Ubuntu Session</h4>
<p>
The following applies to Ubuntu 17.10 and any linux distro using Gnome Shell with the Activities Overview Hot Corner global setting (enable-hot-corners).
</p>
<p>
The Activities Hot Corner is required for proper operation of the Activities Configurator.
The Hot Corner is undefined in the default Ubuntu 17.10 Session. The undefined Hot Corner
caused an "ERROR" when installing the extension from extensions.gnome.org website.
The Hot Corner is undefined because the enable-hot-corners setting is set to false (OFF) in the default Ubuntu Session.
</p>
<p>

2017-11-11 Added detection of undefined Hot Corner
</p>
<p>
The extension has been modified to detect the undefined Hot Corner and not produce an error on installation.  The action taken by the extension depends on four factors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Is the enable-hot-corners setting <b>found</b>?
</li>
<li>
If found, what is the current setting <b>value</b>? 
</li>
<li>
Was the value <b>changed</b>?
</li>
<li>
Is the hot corner <b>undefined</b>?
</li>
</ul>
<h4>F = true V = true C = false U = false OR F = False U = False</h4>
<p>
The Hot Corner is not undefined in a distro with or without the enable-hot-corners setting.
No action is required.
</p><br><br>
<h4>F = true V = false C = false U = true</h4>
<p>
The extension sets enable-hot-corners to true. The Hot Corner is created.
</p>
<h4>F = true V = true C = true U = false</h4>
<p>
The extension displays the following message:
</p>
<img src="./images/hot_corners/HC001.jpg" alt="IMAGE" border="2" valigh="top"  halign="center">
<p>
Since the Hot Corner was removed in the default session by the Ubuntu developers the Hot Corner is disabled on installation of this extension.
As noted in the message it can be enabled (or disabled) by the user with the Disable Hot Corner preference.
The extension also has a preference, Hot Corner Threshold, which can be used to set the sensitivity of the Hot Corner when it is not disabled.
Some users find the Hot Corner is inadvertently activated.  Others find it difficult to activate. Some users are able to use the Hot Corner by setting the Hot Corner Threshold.
The Hot Corner activation problem is hardware dependent and cannot be solved in all cases by setting the Hot Corner Threshold.  
</p><br><br>
<h4>F = true V = false C = false U = true</h4>
<p>
The extension sets enable-hot-corners to true. The Hot Corner is NOT created.
</p>
<h4>F = true V = true C = true U = true</h4>
<p>
The extension displays the following message:
</p>
<img src="./images/hot_corners/HC002.jpg" alt="IMAGE" border="2" valigh="top"  halign="center">
</p><br><br>
<h4>F = False U = true</h4>
<p>
The extension displays the following message:

<h3>If you previously installed the Activities Configurator in Ubuntu 17.10</h3>

<p>
If you received the "ERROR" indicator and wish to install the updated version of the extension please go to installed extensions page
of the ego website and remove the failed installation by clicking the red X.<br>
<a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/local/" target="_blank">Installed Extensions Page</a>
</p>
<p>
After removing the failed installation, log out and login to restart the session. When you re-install the extension 
you should see the following message.<br> 
If you have previously set the Activities Overview Hot Corner to ON the message will not be displayed.<br>
<a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/358/activities-configurator/" target="_blank">
Install Activities Configurator from the Gnome Shell Extension Website</a>
</p>

<p>
Clicking the right (secondary) mouse button on the extension's icon or text will execute the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool.  On the first run of the tool all the
Activities Configurator preferences are set to their default value.  Note the default value for the Disable Hot Corner preference is OFF.
