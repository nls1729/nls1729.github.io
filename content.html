		Please use "Bug report" instead of "Comment" to report problems with an extension. Often<br>
		problems noted in a comment are conflicts with another extension or using a custom theme.<br>
		If a "Bug report" is filed I will contact the user if a valid email address is associated<br>
		with the user's Extension Website account.  If it is a bug I will correct it.  If it is a <br>
		conflict I may or may not be able to provide a resolution.

		The html mailto links used in these pages expect the local email client to be executed with<br>

		operate as expected.  Other browsers may not.  If you have problems using the mailto link,<br>
		please manually copy the email address into your local email client or your webmail service<br>
		email form.
