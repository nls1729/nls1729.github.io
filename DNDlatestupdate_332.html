<h4>Update Version 31 GS 3.28 3.30 3.32</h4>
<p>
Option to mute and restore sound when in the Busy State and Available State.<br><br>

NOTE:
I was contacted by a member of the Fedora team and was informed that they
had a problem packaging version 31 of my extension.  I was unaware that
an RPM was created and was being distrubed by Fedora.  The problem they
reported was due to version 31 modifying itself to be compatible with GObject
registered classes and plain ES6 classes.  Since extensions installed from the
Fedora RPM are placed in /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions and are owned
by root the extension cannot modify its own code.  The solution was to
create two verions of the extension, one for GS 3.30 and one for GS 3.32.
I have uploaded the two versions.
</p>

<h4>Update Version 28 GS 3.32</h4>
<p>
 Changed default icons to be compatible with No Notifications icon in the notifications area of the calendar. 
</p>

A new feature which provides user defined time-out of the busy state is added.

<h4>Update Version 25 GS 3.28 3.30</h4>
<p>

<h4>Update Version 24 GS 3.26 3.28</h4>
<p>
Thanks to p-bo for adding Czech translation.<br><br>
Added code to handle clutter.EventType.TOUCH_BEGIN to act the same as a mouse click of the extension's panel button.  This change is untested.  I do not have a device that generates touch events. <br>
Updated code:<br>
to use arrow notation => instead of Lang.bind for anonymous functions.<br>
to use ES6 classes.<br>
to use GJS ES6 class wrapper for GObject class in prefs.js.<br>
to use Function.prototype.bind() instead of Lang.bind for named call backs.<br>
These changes are provided to accommodate future requirements of the Gnome Shell.
