The <b>Do Not Disturb Button extension</b> defaults to mouse control. A mouse click toggles between the two states of <b>Available</b>
 or <b>Busy</b>.  The extension preferences provide
a keyboard binding to also toggle the availability status.  When the state is set to busy notifications are not displayed with the exception of
critical notifications.
 The icon images <b>Available</b> <img src="./images/available-notifications-symbolic.svg"> and <b>Busy</b> <img src="./images/busy-notifications-symbolic.svg"> 
 are user selectable using the Available and Busy buttons.  
</p>
<p>
Notifications are queued in the Calendar notification area. All notifications may not be shown in the banner display.  Up to three notifications can
be queued for display in the banner. Notifications queued for banner display are presented one by one when the button state is toggled from busy to available.
Any additional notifications can be found in the Calendar notification area. An optional count of active notifications is displayed to the right of the Do Not Disturb Button.
</p>
<p>The default for the <b>shortcut</b> is Disabled.  When editing the shortcut a Backspace will disable the shortcut.
A click under Edit accesses the entry area for a new short cut key or key combination.
The entry area is accessible from the keyboard by typing tabs until the area below Edit is selected and then typing Return.
Before assigning a shortcut, it is recommended to refer to <a href=https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/OS/KeyboardShortcuts>
Gnome Keyboard Shortcuts
</a> for determining keys and key combinations which are currently in use.  A key or key combination which is used by Gnome should not be assigned to this extension. 
</p>
<p>
The <b>Busy State Override At Session Start</b> preference consists
of an "Enable" checkbox, "Busy" radiobutton and "Available" radiobutton.
If "Enable" is unchecked, the default is the state of the extension panel button
controls the busy state indicated by the icon in a persistent manner.  Whatever state the
icon indicated when the session ended or was interrupted by a screen lock or
user switch determines the state at the next session login or re-login
after a screen lock or user switch.  If the "Enable" is checked the state indicated by the selected radiobutton will only be set at
new session startup logins <img src="./images/gnome-session-reboot.png">; otherwise, the persistent behavoir set
by the extension panel button is in effect <img src="./images/default-persistence.png">.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Busy State Timeout</b> feature provides user options to schedule one-time or recurring time-outs. 
The Panel Button has been changed. It continues to toggle the
extension state between Busy and Available when clicked with the
primary mouse button.  Since the Preferences Tool will be involved
with using the Busy State Timeout Feature, quick access to the
tool is provided by a secondary mouse click of the Panel Button.<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Icons: </b>
When a Busy State Timeout starts an icon is displayed, ⏳. 

When the Busy State Timeout Feature is enabled by checking the
Enable Checkbox the duration of the timeout is calculated and
displayed along with an icon, ⌛.
