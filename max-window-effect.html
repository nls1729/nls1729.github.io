        <h2>Maximum Window Effect</h2>
        <p>When a window is maximized on the primary screen the panel is set to opaque black.  
        This extension can be used in conjunction with themes which set the panel transparent or a color not harmonious with a maximized window.
        When the panel color is changed to black the panel text and icons are changed to white.  
        When the window is un-maximized the original panel appearance is restored.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  This effect is optionally provided by the Activities Configurator Extension.  
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  This extension is not available from the ego website.
