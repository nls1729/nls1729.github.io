<h4>Update Version 75 GS 3.32</h4>
<p>
User reported unable to close a message concerning missing hot corners. POP OS 19.04 is based on Ubuntu which has
a patch applied to the shell which causes the missing hot corners.  Gnome Shell 3.32 apparently does not allow a
reactive St.Bin which was used to close the message. The St.Bin has been replaced with an St.Button to fix the problem.
</p>

<h4>Update Version 74 GS 3.32</h4>
<p>
Removed disable enable code not needed.
</p>

<h4>Update Version 73 GS 3.32</h4>
<p>
Added disable-enable on monitor change to handle loss of diabled hot corner
for laptop.  Changed Tile Maximized Effect to be more efficient.
Changes for GS3.32 are not compatible with earlier versions. Changing
metadata.json to reflect only version 3.32.  Added set and get methods to
the ActivitiesIconButton GObject class to allow access to variables that
are not visible to previous javascript.  Modified the previous javascript
to use the get and set methods.  Added imports.misc.util to replace calls
where the util code was previously accessible through main.js.  Increased
delay for feature to move the ActivitiesIconButton from top left corner to
top right corner.
Removed un-needed "_( )" and added needed "_( )"for translations.  Now xgettext
should find everything and gettext will not be executed when not needed.
</p>

<h4>Update Version 71 GS 3.28 3.30</h4>
<p>
Found bug requiring an additional line of code to handle the
Tile Maximized Effect Off option correctly.
Changed Tile Maximized Effect to remove panel transparency when a window is
tiled on the primary monitor and a Window Maximized Effect preference is
selected.
</p>

<h4>Update Version 69 GS 3.28 3.30</h4>
<p>
Added Tile Maximize Effect.  When tiling windows in native Gnome Shell two
windows on the primary monitor will be adjacent to the panel.  If the panel
has transparency applied the look is not good.  The Tile Maximize Effect
applies the Window Maximize Effect of Opaque Background Color or Black Opaque
Background to the panel if an option is selected.  The option to turn the
Tile Maximized Effect Off in the preferences is provided in case of a conflict
with an installed tiling extension. Thanks to Micha Preußer for reporting the
tiling appearance issue.
</p>

<h4>Update Version 68 GS 3.28 3.30</h4>
<p>
When logging in from a locked screen, the Window Maximized Effect opaque panel
background preferences were ignored. The problem was fixed by moving enabling the
Window Maximized Effect preferences to later in the delayed enable function.
Also code was added to prevent the Show Overview If No Applications Are Running
preference from being falsely activated when returning from a locked screen.<br>
Thanks to Micha Preußer for reporting the Window Maximized Effect issue.
</p>

<h4>Update Version 67 GS 3.28 3.30</h4>
<p>
Completed changes for ES6.
Changed code to use arrow notation => instead of Lang.bind for anonymous functions. Changed code to use ES6 classes. Updated prefs.js to use GJS ES6
class wrapper for GObject class. Changed to use Function.prototype.bind() instead of Lang.bind for named call backs.  Changed let and const to var for
modules with symbols to be exported.  "....according to the ES6 standard. Any symbols to be exported from a module must be defined with 'var'."
For GS 3.30 changed max window effect to handle change of global.screen to global.display, changed workspace access from global.screen to
global.workspace_manager, changed acess of signals from global.window_manager to Main.wm._shellwm.
</p>

<h4>Update Version 66 GS 3.26 3.28 GS 3.30</h4>
<p>
Fixed class names to be compatible with GS 3.30
</p>


<h4>Update Version 65 GS 3.26 3.28</h4>
<p>
Removed line 15 of prefs.js, "const Colors = Me.imports.colors;". Reported by jessedubord.  Ubuntu 18.04 beta 2, Gnome 3.28. Github issue #34 nls1729/acme-code. "There was an error loading the preferences dialog for Activities Configurator:" "Error: Requiring Clutter ..."
The import was no longer needed. In 2013 (version 16) functions provided by the import were replaced with a different set of functions.  The import should have been removed then.

</p>
<h4>Version 49 3.16 3.18 3.20 3.21.90 3.21.91 3.21.92</h4>
<p>The <b>Show Overview after Login</b> preference has been extended to become the <b>Show Overview if No Applications are Running</b> preference. 
With this preference the Overview is displayed after login and anytime the last application window is closed to provide quick access to the Applications menu.  
</p>
<h4>Version 47 3.16 3.18 3.20</h4>
<p>The <b>Move Activities to the Right</b> preference was added to the extension.
This preference when selected moves the Activities Button to the right corner of the Panel.
The Hot Corner location remains in the left corner of the Panel.  This option was a user's request.
<h4>Version 46 3.16 3.18 3.20</h4>
<p>The <b>Show Overview after Login</b> preference was added to the extension. 
This option was a user's suggestion that displaying the Overview after login would save 
a step for users who want access to the the Applications menu and Favorites at the start of their 
session.</p>
<h4>Version 44  GS 3.16 3.18 3.20</h4>
<p>The <b>Override Shell Theme</b> preference was added to the extension.
The addition of configurable shadow options in version 40 created the need
to provide an option to allow user control of the actions of the extension
in conjunction with <b>User Themes</b> and the <b>Gnome Classic Mode</b>.<br>&nbsp<br>
The following settings interact with User Themes and the Gnome Classic Mode:<br>
Set Panel Background, Panel Transparency, Panel Shadow Color, Transparency,
Vertical Length, Blur Radius, Spread Radius and Window Maximized Effect.<br>&nbsp<br>
These options are designed to function with the default Gnome Mode and the default Shell Theme.
Available User Themes are common and are written in ways that do not behave in the same manner
as the default Shell Theme.The Classic Mode Theme is different from the default Shell Theme.
Depending on the user's tastes and the theme installed the extension's preferences can be used
in a useful way.  In some cases some settings are not effective or are not useful.
The Override Shell Theme preference allows the user to enable or disable the interactions of
the settings that affect the installed theme. The default for the setting is OFF, all
listed panel options will not interact with an installed User Theme or when in the
Gnome Classic Mode. The user can set it to ON allowing the listed settings to override
or interact with the installed theme.  When operating in the default Gnome Mode with
the default Shell Theme installed the switch is set to OFF and is not sensitive. When a
theme change occurs from the default Shell Theme to a User Theme or the session is in
the Gnome Classic Mode the switch is set sensitive in the OFF position.  If the
user wishes to use any of the listed settings the switch can be set to ON.
The option will remain ON until the user sets it to OFF or the theme is changed or the mode changes.
