</p>
<h4>Version 49 3.16 3.18 3.20 3.21.90 3.21.91 3.21.92</h4>
<p>The <b>Show Overview after Login</b> preference has been extended to become the <b>Show Overview if No Applications are Running</b> preference. 
With this preference the Overview is displayed after login and anytime the last application window is closed to provide quick access to the Applications menu.  
</p>
<h4>Version 47 3.16 3.18 3.20</h4>
<p>The <b>Move Activities to the Right</b> preference was added to the extension.
This preference when selected moves the Activities Button to the right corner of the Panel.
The Hot Corner location remains in the left corner of the Panel.  This option was a user's request.
<h4>Version 46 3.16 3.18 3.20</h4>
<p>The <b>Show Overview after Login</b> preference was added to the extension. 
This option was a user's suggestion that displaying the Overview after login would save 
a step for users who want access to the the Applications menu and Favorites at the start of their 
session.</p>
<h4>Version 44  GS 3.16 3.18 3.20</h4>
<p>The <b>Override Shell Theme</b> preference was added to the extension.
The addition of configurable shadow options in version 40 created the need
to provide an option to allow user control of the actions of the extension
in conjunction with <b>User Themes</b> and the <b>Gnome Classic Mode</b>.<br>&nbsp<br>
The following settings interact with User Themes and the Gnome Classic Mode:<br>
Set Panel Background, Panel Transparency, Panel Shadow Color, Transparency,
Vertical Length, Blur Radius, Spread Radius and Window Maximized Effect.<br>&nbsp<br>
These options are designed to function with the default Gnome Mode and the default Shell Theme.
Available User Themes are common and are written in ways that do not behave in the same manner
as the default Shell Theme.The Classic Mode Theme is different from the default Shell Theme.
Depending on the user's tastes and the theme installed the extension's preferences can be used
in a useful way.  In some cases some settings are not effective or are not useful.
The Override Shell Theme preference allows the user to enable or disable the interactions of
the settings that affect the installed theme. The default for the setting is OFF, all
listed panel options will not interact with an installed User Theme or when in the
Gnome Classic Mode. The user can set it to ON allowing the listed settings to override
or interact with the installed theme.  When operating in the default Gnome Mode with
the default Shell Theme installed the switch is set to OFF and is not sensitive. When a
theme change occurs from the default Shell Theme to a User Theme or the session is in
the Gnome Classic Mode the switch is set sensitive in the OFF position.  If the
user wishes to use any of the listed settings the switch can be set to ON.
The option will remain ON until the user sets it to OFF or the theme is changed or the mode changes.
