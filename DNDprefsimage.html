The <b>Do Not Disturb Button extension</b> defaults to mouse control. A mouse click toggles between the two states of <b>Available</b>
<img src="./images/available-yes.png"> or <b>Busy</b> <img src="./images/available-no.png">.  The extension preferences provide
a keyboard binding to also toggle the availability status.  When the state is set to busy notifications are not displayed with the exception of
critical notifications.
</p>
<p>
Notifications are queued in the Calendar notification area. All notifications may not be shown in the banner display.  Up to three notifications can
be queued for display in the banner. Notifications queued for banner display are presented one by one when the button state is toggled from busy to available.
Any additional notifications can be found in the Calendar notification area. A count of active notifications is displayed to the right of the Do Not Disturb Button.
</p>
<p>The default for the <b>shortcut</b> is Disabled.  When editing the shortcut a Backspace will disable the shortcut.
A click under Edit accesses the entry area for a new short cut key or key combination.
The entry area is accessible from the keyboard by typing tabs until the area below Edit is selected and then typing Return.							  
</p>
<p>Before assigning a shortcut, it is recommended to refer to <a href=https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/OS/KeyboardShortcuts>
Gnome Keyboard Shortcuts
</a> for determining keys and key combinations which are currently in use.  A key or key combination which is used by Gnome should not be assigned to this extension.
