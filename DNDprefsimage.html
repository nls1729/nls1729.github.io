<p>The <b>Do Not Disturb extension</b> defaults to mouse control. A mouse click toggles between the two states of <b>Available</b> 
<img src="./images/available-yes.png"> or <b>Busy</b> <img src="./images/available-no.png">.  The extension preferences provide
a keyboard binding to also toggle the availability status.  When the state is set to busy notifications are not displayed with the exception of
critical notifications.
</p>
<p>
Usually notifications are presented one by one when the state is toggled from busy to available.  Notifications are also queued in the
Calendar notification area. All notifications may not be shown in the banner display.  The Calendar should always be checked
after toggling from busy to available for notifications not displayed because of Screen Shield, Lock Screen or receipt of multiple notifications.
</p>
<p>The default for the <b>shortcut</b> is Disabled.  When editing the shortcut a Backspace will disable the shortcut.
A click under Edit accesses the entry area for a new short cut key or key combination.
The entry area is accessible from the keyboard by typing tabs until the area below Edit is selected and then typing Return.							  
</p>
<p>Before assigning a shortcut, it is recommended to refer to <a href=https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/OS/KeyboardShortcuts>
Gnome Keyboard Shortcuts
</a> for determining keys and key combinations which are currently in use.  A key or key combination which is used by Gnome should not be assigned to this extension.
